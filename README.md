Here we learn about Hierarchial Clustering representations and dendrogram using Single, 
complete, and average link proximity function in hierarchical clustering technique. (Mathematically)

And Also preprocessing the data, scaling and  Normalizing the data 
Then applying Feature Reduction methid PCA (principal component Analysis) which gives 2 columns (K=2)
Then implementing AgglomerativeClustering (Bottom-up approach) with number of clusters as 2,3,4 and 5 with 
respective representation of scatter plot.
Finally representing the silhoulette score of all the 4 outcomes into a bar chart.
